BenchTwelve is a new free web font. It's design is loosely based on the look of the ink spreads and bleeds characteristic of traditional or vernacular woodcut type. The design takes a mash-up of a number of old Stephenson Blake designs and rounds the corners a little. The weights will eventually go from skinny to black, plus a condensed version of the face, though first release will probably be plain regular, bold and, maybe, black. In theory the face should work well for headlines that want to stand out just a little from the crowd.
